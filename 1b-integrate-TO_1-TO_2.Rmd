## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r read-data}
readRDS("./data/TO_1.rds") #reads in data, which was normalized in 1
readRDS("./data/TO_2.rds") # reads in data2d, which has not been preprocessed

data2d <- NormalizeData(data2d, normalization.method = "LogNormalize", scale.factor = 10000)
data2d <- FindVariableFeatures(data2d, selection.method = "vst", nfeatures = 2000)


```

```{r integrate-seurat, echo=FALSE}
features <- SelectIntegrationFeatures(object.list = c(data, data2d))
anchors <- FindIntegrationAnchors(object.list = c(data, data2d), anchor.features = features)
data.combined <- IntegrateData(anchorset = anchors)

```

```{r integrated-analysis}
DefaultAssay(data.combined) <- "integrated"

# Run the standard workflow for visualization and clustering
data.combined <- ScaleData(data.combined, verbose = FALSE)
data.combined <- RunPCA(data.combined, npcs = 30, verbose = FALSE)
data.combined <- RunUMAP(data.combined, reduction = "pca", dims = 1:30)
data.combined <- FindNeighbors(data.combined, reduction = "pca", dims = 1:30)
data.combined <- FindClusters(data.combined, resolution = 0.5)

p1 <- DimPlot(data.combined, reduction = "umap", group.by = "orig.ident")
p2 <- DimPlot(data.combined, reduction = "umap", label = TRUE, repel = TRUE)
p1 + p2
```
