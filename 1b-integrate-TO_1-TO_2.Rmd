## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r read-data}
readRDS("./data/TO_1.rds") #reads in data, which was normalized in 1
readRDS("./data/TO_2.rds") # reads in data2d, which has not been preprocessed

data2d <- NormalizeData(data2d, normalization.method = "LogNormalize", scale.factor = 10000)
data2d <- FindVariableFeatures(data2d, selection.method = "vst", nfeatures = 2000)


```
```{r data2d-alone}
top10 <- head(VariableFeatures(data2d), 10)

plot1 <- VariableFeaturePlot(data2d)
plot2 <- LabelPoints(plot = plot1, points = top10, repel = TRUE)
plot2

all.genes <- rownames(data2d)
data2d <- ScaleData(data2d, features = all.genes)

data2d <- RunPCA(data2d, features = VariableFeatures(object = data))
VizDimLoadings(data2d, dims = 1:2, reduction = "pca")
DimPlot(data2d, reduction = "pca")

data2d <- FindNeighbors(data2d, dims = 1:10)
data2d <- FindClusters(data2d, resolution = 0.5)
data2d <- RunUMAP(data2d, dims = 1:10)
DimPlot(data2d, reduction = "umap")
```
```{r genes-of-interest}

FeaturePlot(data2d, features = c("POU2F3","YAP1", "HES1","REST"))

saveRDS(data2d, file = "./data/TO_2.rds")

```


```{r integrate-seurat, echo=FALSE}
features <- SelectIntegrationFeatures(object.list = c(data, data2d))
anchors <- FindIntegrationAnchors(object.list = c(data, data2d), anchor.features = features)
data.combined <- IntegrateData(anchorset = anchors)

```

```{r integrated-analysis}
DefaultAssay(data.combined) <- "integrated"

# Run the standard workflow for visualization and clustering
data.combined <- ScaleData(data.combined, verbose = FALSE)
data.combined <- RunPCA(data.combined, npcs = 30, verbose = FALSE)
data.combined <- RunUMAP(data.combined, reduction = "pca", dims = 1:30)
data.combined <- FindNeighbors(data.combined, reduction = "pca", dims = 1:30)
data.combined <- FindClusters(data.combined, resolution = 0.5)

p1 <- DimPlot(data.combined, reduction = "umap", group.by = "orig.ident")
p2 <- DimPlot(data.combined, reduction = "umap", label = TRUE, repel = TRUE)
p1 + p2
```
```{r gene-plots}
FeaturePlot(data.combined, features = c("YAP1", "HES1"), blend = TRUE)
VlnPlot(data.combined, features = c("YAP1", "HES1"))
